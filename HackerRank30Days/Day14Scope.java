/*
The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is written as |a - b|. 
The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, 
elements, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in __elements.

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. 
It has a private integer array (elements) for storing N non-negative integers, 
and a public integer (maximumDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Task
Complete the Difference class by writing the following:
    - A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it
    to the __elements instance variable.
    - A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between
    any 2 numbers in __elements and stores it in the maximumDifference instance 
    variable.

Input Format
You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class
in the editor reads in 2 lines of input. The first line contains N, the size of the
elements array. The second line has N space-separated integers that describe the
__elements array.

Constraints
    - 1 <= N <= 10
    - 1 <= __elements[i] <= 100, where 0 <= i <= N - 1

Output Format
You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the
value of the maximumDifference instance variable.

Sample Input
STDIN   Function
-----   -----------------------
3       __elements[] size N = 3
1 2 5   __elements = [1, 2, 5]

Sample Output
4

Explanation
The scope of the __elements array and maximumDifference integer is the entire class
instance. The class constructor saves the argument passed to the constructor as the
__elements instance variable (where the computeDifference method can access it).

To find the maximum difference, computeDifference checks each element in the array
and finds the maximum difference between any 2 elements: 
|1 - 2| = 1
|1 - 5| = 4
|2 - 5| = 3

The maximum of these differences is 4, so it saves the value 4 as the maximumDifference
instance variable. The locked stub code in the editor then prints the value stored
as maximumDifference, which is 4.
